# mlops-pipelining
This repository demonstrates how to build and manage machine learning and data pipelines using DVC (Data Version Control), AWS S3 for remote storage, and YAML configuration files for workflow automation. The project highlights best practices for structuring reproducible pipelines, tracking data and model versions, and ensuring collaboration across teams. By leveraging DVC, large datasets and model artifacts can be versioned efficiently without bloating the repository. AWS S3 integration provides scalable cloud storage for data and experiment results, while YAML files define pipeline stages, making the workflow transparent and easy to reproduce. This setup allows users to run experiments consistently, roll back to previous versions, and maintain a clean, automated workflow for data-driven projects. The repository is lightweight, flexible, and designed to scale from local experiments to production-ready pipelines.
